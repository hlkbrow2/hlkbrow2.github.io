                <p>Eating out in the evening can be expensive for frugal students, so make the most of Liverpool’s Special Offers site, where discount deals and offers for some of the best restaurants in town will make eating out in Liverpool easy on your pocket, if not on your waist line!</p>

                <p>In general I’d say restaurants with an ‘experience’ tend to serve lack-lustre food.

                This, however, is not the case at Sapporo Teppanyaki, in Duke Street. Their Japanese food is centered around theatrical cooking on hot plates by skilled chefs in front of diners. The menu has an extensive sushi and hot appetizer selection followed by an equally diverse selection of dishes made on the grill.

                We were presented on arrival with the drinks menu of fusion cocktails. My Suntory Old Fashioned was too sweet for my taste but my dining partner found it very agreeable. 

                The sushi has to be commended. As honorary Scousers we ordered the Liverpool Roll; smoked salmon, cream cheese and rice rolled in roe. Generally the idea of smoked salmon and cream cheese in sushi offends me but in this case I was pleasantly surprised and would in fact recommend it to others.

                My fellow diner is vegan so we were expecting her sushi selection to be limited, however the extremely helpful and attentive server was able to suggest delicious alternatives (an amended avocado roll).The tuna nigiri was fresh and hit the spot. Watching the teppanyaki dishes being cooked was fun and interactive- plenty of jokes between chefs and diners with running gags throughout the meal.

                The food itself was enjoyable and tasty. My salmon with Japanese 'seven flavour chilli pepper' sauce was not as spicy as I’d hoped and the salmon slightly over cooked.However, this didn’t detract from the rest of the meal and my friend’s gigantic Kimono Roll. Vegetarians and vegans are not overlooked! Both our main dishes were served with sides of fried potato and egg fried rice (sorry vegan friend).Sapporo Teppanyaki is an entertaining dining experience which doesn’t forget about the importance of good food.

                Ordering from the al a carte menu is rather dear so I would recommend Sapporo Teppanyaki for an occasion – it could be perfect for a birthday or graduation celebration.</p>
