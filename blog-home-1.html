                <p>Sometimes a bowl of cereal just won’t cut it. Nothing beats a Full English breakfast, and there are a multitude of cafes and restaurants in Liverpool that make an excellent fry-up.</p>

                <p>We usually spend our days wandering the winding streets of Liverpool but today we decided we would enter the realms of the bustling business district. As we sat down on a bench soaking up the hectic atmosphere full of modern professionals on their way to their mid-day rendezvous, we decided we needed to move away from the rather serious and corporate atmosphere. Although we had heard some riveting reviews from fellow friends about Moose Coffee, it was the antlers hanging from the roof that turned our window shopping into a sit down meal. Located on 6 Dale Street, Moose is a favourite amongst some of the most important people in the city who use Moose as a way to revitalise themselves whilst having some fun in the process. We eventually went for the infamoose (couldn’t resist) Moose Breakfast as, for  many, this is the best way to start the day. It was a concoction of garlic and mustard potatoes, perfectly fried eggs, bacon and thick toast. 

                We then decided to go for another beloved breakfast amongst the Moose regulars which was the New York Moose, New York on a plate but much more than a big apple. Crisp and delicate Parma ham lay on top of runny in the middle poached eggs that rested on soft muffins – this alone would have been enough, but the whole meal was then saturated in a sticky and succulent hollandaise sauce that was a compliment to every flavour present.

                It is coming to places like Moose coffee that really instills in us that passion for why we started this venture. There is so much homogeneity in the world and although the bright lights of Starbucks and your name on the cup as well as the red cup synonymous with Costa may be enticing, the true beauty of exploring one’s city is surely to find the places that are unique to your own? To the average punter, Moose may just be a great breakfast haunt with a Moose’s head on top of Benjamin Franklins’ body, but to us this is a statement that there are still a daring few willing to take risks in and enjoy their success so much more when they pay off. Like them on Facebook ‘Moose Coffee’ and follow them on Twitter @MooseCoffee but make sure you head down soon.</p>
